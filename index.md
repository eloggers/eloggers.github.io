I am a PhD student in the Litt Lab in the [Department of Ecology](https://www.montana.edu/ecology/) at Montana State University. My dissertation works to understand the causes and consequences of behavioral variation among individuals and how these differences translate to demographic outcomes and population persistence across changing environments.
